# Mobile Coding Challenge

## Idea of the app

The task is to implement an app that lists news, and a single page with swiping feature.

## Base Requirements

-   Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
-   Source code on Github (Show us your work through your commit history!)
-   Use for Ios (Swift 5 or SwiftUI) or Android (Kotlin) according to your application

## Features

-   Show the top menu list based on the json feed here: https://www.hespress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories
-	Show posts with an infinite scroll by increasing the number of the page to get the next one, based on the json feed here: https://www.hespress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?page=1
-	The data must be stored locally for offline mode
-	Show single page based on stored data
-   Swipe between articles (you may just swipe into 10 of the recent posts)

## How we'll evaluate 🚨

-   Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices, legibility.
-   The git commit history will be also evaluated.
-   Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines?
-   Put more focus on code quality and less on speed. Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean.

## Once you're done with the app

Put the code of your project on Github and send the URL to us.
