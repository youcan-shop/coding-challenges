## Context

- You should build a small and concise app the right way, based on Themosis 2.0.

- The app contains the notion of items, with some features and interactions.

- The goal of this test is more to evaluate the way of thinking, design and quality of code (We accept juniors and seniors).

- CSS & colors are not evaluated.
 
## Technologies to use
 
- Themosis / Wordpress / Blade templating
- PHP7 / MySQL
        
## Brief

### Terms

- An item is a custom post with title, image and description and one or many categories.
- A visitor is a non logged user.
- An author is a logged user with Author permission.

### Features
#### Backoffice
- As an author, I can add/edit/remove/publish/unpublish items.
- As an author, I need to list all items with custom columns in this order: 
1. Status (published, draft, etc)
2. Title
3. Categories
4. Image (miniature)
5. Author   
6. Date

### Front
- As a visitor, I can browse all published items from the homepage with pagination (home).
- As a visitor, I can display an item (single).
- As the owner of an item, I can edit an item by using a button edit displayed in this item page.

### CLI (Commandline features)
- I should be able to change a user password from the command line.
- I should be able to seed fake data (10000 items / 100 users) from the command line.

## Evaluation criteria 🚨
- Accuracy to follow instructions.
- Respect of software engineering principles : DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID.
- Code readability and coding style (PSR).
- Clean commit history in git making code review easy, push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
- Quality of documentation (The readme should be short and concise, like open source projects readme).

## Instructions
- Put more focus on code quality and less on speed. 
- Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean, with layers and separation of concerns.
- Write a readable and maintainable code.
