## How to participate
1. Read the instructions carefully and do not hesitate to check the **Links and resources** section before you start. 
2. When you're ready to start the test, make sure you init a Github repository and share the link by email to **tech-challenge@youcan.shop** with the object **Coding Challenge Data Engineer application by FirstName LastName**, and cc **lmouad@youcan.shop**, it'll be considered as the time your started working on the challenge.
3. Once you're done with the test, reply again by email to notify us you're done with it. 


## Scenarios
Youâ€™re joining the data team at an e-commerce platform and are tasked with analyzing user behavior to:
1. Improve database performance
2. Understand retention and behavior trends
3. Create intelligent user segments using AI

#### Data
Find a way to populate a significant amount of data for at least twelve months

### Challenge Breakdown

### Part I: Data Exploration & SQL Query Optimization 

#### Context
You have access to a PostgreSQL (or BigQuery) database with the following tables:

- users(user_id, signup_date, country)

- events(user_id, event_type [viewed, add-to-cart, purchased], product_id, timestamp)

- products(product_id, category, price)

#### Tasks
1. Provide the following analysis:

    - Weekly active users

    - Revenue per category

2. Rewrite those queries to optimize them (using indexes, refactored logic, etc.)

3. Use Python to benchmark performance before and after (execution time for each stage, etc.)
#### Deliverables:
- Optimized SQL queries

- Python script (using psycopg2, sqlalchemy, or google-cloud-bigquery) for execution + profiling

- Brief report on bottlenecks and improvements

### Part II: Cohort analysis
Working with python (clean, transform and process data), create a cohort analysis to analyze stores retention.

#### Context:
You want to analyze retention patterns of users based on their signup month.

#### Tasks:
1. Group users into monthly cohorts

2. Calculate how many users from each cohort returned weekly for 8 weeks

3. Use Python to visualize the retention matrix (heatmap or line graph)

#### Deliverables:
- SQL cohort query (BigQuery or python syntax are preferred)

- Python code for visualization (Pandas + Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly)



### Part III: Behavioral Segmentation with Elasticsearch & AI

#### Context:
User session logs (searches, clicks) are stored in Elasticsearch.

#### Sample document structure:
```
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "search_query": "wireless headphones",
  "clicked_product_ids": ["p01", "p02"],
  "timestamp": "2025-04-01T12:30:00Z"
}
```
#### Tasks:

1. Use Python to extract user search history from Elasticsearch

2. Use an AI API (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings, Hugging Face) to convert search queries into vectors

3. Cluster users using K-means or another technique into meaningful groups (e.g., tech-savvy, budget-conscious, fashion-oriented)

4. *Optionally*: Store segmented users into a new Elasticsearch index with tags like "segment": "tech_enthusiast"

Final Deliverables
- âœ… A Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts folder

- âœ… SQL files (or queries embedded in notebook)

- âœ… One-page strategy document explaining:

    - Optimizations made

    - Retention insights

    - Segmentation rationale

- âœ… Bonus: Dockerized environment or setup instructions for ease of testing
