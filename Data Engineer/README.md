## Evaluation criteria ðŸš¨
- Accuracy to follow instructions with attention to details.
- Clean commit history in git making code review easy, push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
- Quality of documentation (The readme should be short and concise, as a getting started guide).
 
- Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean, with layers and separation of concerns.

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate the way of thinking, design and quality of code.
