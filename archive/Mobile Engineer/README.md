## Context

The task is to implement an app that lists news, and a single page with swiping feature.

## Base Requirements

-   Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
-   Source code on Github (Show us your work through your commit history!)
-   Use for Ios (Swift 5 using SwiftUI) or Android (Kotlin) according to your application
-   Use MVVM as a design pattern + Dependency injection 

## Features

-	Show posts with an infinite scroll by increasing the number of the page to get the next one, based on the json feed here: http://soltana.ma/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?page=1  (use design)
-	The data must be stored locally for offline mode 
-	Show single page based on stored data (show just the title without using design)

## API Endpoints

## How we'll evaluate ðŸš¨

-   Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices, legibility.
-   The git commit history will be also evaluated.
-   Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines?
-   Put more focus on code quality and less on speed. Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean.

## Once you're done with the app

Put the code of your project on Github and send the URL to us.
