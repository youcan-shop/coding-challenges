## Challenge
Using the GitHub API. We want to create a leaders board for contributors to a repository:
- As a user, I can list my repositories.
- As a user, I can select a repository from the list
- As a user, I can see the list of users by their username, count PR reviews, count PRs.
    - The table is ordered by the number of PRs the user reviewed.
    - Contain only last month stats (the duration should be easily changeable)

Username    Reviewed PRs    Opened PRs
whyounes        30              12

Below are important points to be present in the solution:
- Unit tests.
- CI/CD using GitHub action on push to master.
- Backoff strategy implementation when communicating with GitHub API.
- Application architecture is to be considered. (Separated service, encapsulation, clean API).
- Consider the rate limitation of the GitHub API.

NOTE: Donâ€™t use a PHP package for the GitHub API calls.

## Evaluation criteria ðŸš¨
- Accuracy to follow instructions.
- Code readability and coding style (PSR).
- Clean commit history in git making code review easy, push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
- Quality of documentation (The readme should be short and concise, like open source projects readme, it should contain all necessary step to build and make the app running.
