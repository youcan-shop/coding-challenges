- CSS & colors are not evaluated.
 
## Technologies to use
 
- Themosis / Wordpress / Blade templating
- PHP7 / MySQL

## Evaluation criteria ðŸš¨
- Accuracy to follow instructions.
- Respect of software engineering principles : DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID.
- Code readability and coding style (PSR).
- Clean commit history in git making code review easy, push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
